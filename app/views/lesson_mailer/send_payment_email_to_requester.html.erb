    <p>Hello <%= @lesson.requester.name.split(" ").first %>,</p>
    <p>
      We hope you thoroughly enjoyed your Snow Schoolers experience and that your lesson today with <%=@lesson.instructor.first_name %> exceeded your expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have likely already received an SMS message asking you to complete your lesson online by giving <%=@lesson.instructor.first_name %> a brief review out of 5-stars, and we thank you for <b> considering giving <%=@lesson.instructor.first_name %> a tip </b> if it was deserved. As you may be aware, ski instructors in the U.S. only make a small fraction of the lesson fee amount, usually between $15-20 per hour (source: <a href="https://www.snowskool.com/blog/ski-instructor-salaries-2016-how-much-do-instructors-earn-get-paid-make"> Snowskool, 2016</a>), and thus tips are incredibly appreciated. If you'd like to learn more about what Snow Schoolers is doing to help increase instructor wages, please <a href="mailto:info@snowschoolers.com">let us know</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
