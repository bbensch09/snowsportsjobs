		<b>Summary:</b> The only ski area on the west shore of Tahoe, Homewood has the hands-down best views of the lake, and with a top-to-bottom beginner run, the view can be enjoyed by skiers of any ability. With beginner packages including a ticket, rental, and lesson that start at just $59 per day, it's also the most budget-friendly place to learn how to ski.

	<h3>
		<b>Summary:</b> Arguably the most remote and hardest resort in Tahoe to get to (one-lane windy road on the avalanche-prone SR-88), it’s 100% worth it if you can get there. With no shortage of expert chutes and cliff drops, from “the wall” to The Cirque, Kirkwood has plenty to keep the adrenaline going. With a peak elevation nearing 10,000 feet and the highest average snowfall in Tahoe at 500”, it deserves to be on every Tahoe skier’s bucket list.

	<h3>
		<b>Summary:</b> If you are looking for the most extreme, challenging, and diverse terrain in Tahoe, you'll find it at Squaw. Famous for hosting the winter Olympics back in 1960, Squaw has steadily developed into arguably Tahoe's biggest mega-resort, with nearly 30 lifts across six unique mountain peaks, and a base village area complete with a full array of luxury accomodations, restaurants and retail. The only downside? Crowds. As its popularity as swelled, so has the average lift line wait, which can run upwards of 20-25 minutes on Saturdays and throughout holiday weekends.

Famously split across the California side and the Nevada side, Heavenly has something for everyone, from wide long intermediate runs to the narrow steep chutes of the Mott and Killebrew canyons.

		<b>Summary:</b> Despite having the highest base elevation in all of Tahoe at nearly 7,900 feet, Mount Rose remains virtually unknown amongst casual skiers & snowboarders from the Bay Area. Instead, it is the most popular ski area amongst Reno residents, just 30-minutes away from downtown Reno. While it receives significantly less precipitation due to its easterly location, its high elevation means that rain is almost never a concern, even when warm subtropical storms bring the dreaded "wintry mix" to lake level.
