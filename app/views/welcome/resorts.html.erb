	<h3>
		<b>Summary:</b> The only ski area on the west shore of Tahoe, Homewood has the hands-down best views of the lake, and with a top-to-bottom beginner run, the view can be enjoyed by skiers of any ability. With beginner packages including a ticket, rental, and lesson that start at just $59 per day, it's also the most budget-friendly place to learn how to ski.

	<h3>
		<b>Summary:</b> While lesser known than its sister-mountain Squaw Valley, Alpine is a favorite among locals, known for its relaxed atmosphere and variety of beginner to expert terrain. Since much of Alpine's best lines are only accessible via short 5-15 minute hikes, most causal skiers stay away, leaving plenty of fresh stashes for those who know where to look. On your last run of the day, relax with a beer in one of the many dozens of adirondack chairs surrounding the open fire pits on the deck.
